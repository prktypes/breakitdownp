# BreakItDown - Adaptive Learning Platform

## 📌 Overview
BreakItDown is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to enhance knowledge retention using scientifically validated study techniques. It provides an interactive flashcard-based learning system, integrating active recall, spaced repetition, and real-time analytics for optimized learning.

## 🚀 Features
- **Flashcard-Based Learning** - Breaks down topics into digestible flashcards for structured learning.
- **Active Recall Integration** - Reinforces memory retention by prompting users with interactive questions.
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm** - Implements an Anki-like review system for long-term retention.
- **Personalized Dashboard** - Tracks learning progress with insights and a GitHub-style contribution grid.
- **AI-Generated Quizzes** - Uses OpenAI/Llama3/Mixtral to create intelligent, adaptive assessments.
- **Secure Authentication** - Ensures user data security with Firebase/Supabase/Auth0.
- **Mobile-Responsive UI** - Provides a seamless learning experience across all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- React.js / Next.js (for SSR optimization)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

### Backend:
- Node.js with Express.js (API development)
- MongoDB (Database management)

### Authentication:
- Auth0 (User authentication and security)

### Hosting & Deployment:
- Vercel (Frontend hosting)
- Render (Backend deployment)

### AI & Machine Learning:
- Gemini API (AI-driven learning optimizations)

## 🧠 Scientific Principles Used
- **Cognitive Load Theory** - Minimizes unnecessary distractions to improve learning efficiency.
